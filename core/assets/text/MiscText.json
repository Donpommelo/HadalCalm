  "misc": "It is recommended to play the game in fullscreen mode. (Enabled in SETTINGS -> DISPLAY)\n\nThe game can be played with local or remote multiplayer. To host a server remotely, enable port forwarding on the chosen port. (default port: 11100)\n\nServer capacity can be set in SETTINGS -> MISC. It is recommended to leave this at 4 for performance reasons.\n\nThere exists a connection bug where a client will not load all of the map events. If this happens, return to the hub to hopefully fix it.\n\nWhile intended for single-player, the campaign can be done with a friend by hosting a server and selecting the map \"sstunicate1\" from the bonus level event.\n\nThe majority of the game's filesize is taken up by high-quality, uncompressed bird photos.",
  "tips": "Eggplant Mode can be enabled in SETTINGS -> GAME -> PVP MODE. In this mode, players score by collecting Eggplants that spawn in the map.\n\nThis game is best played with headphones. Sounds can warn to the prescence and location of enemies.\n\nAirblast can be used to reflect enemy projectiles. Reflected projectiles deal bonus damage.\n\nIf you don't want to grind for currency, just go to the sandbox in the bonus level event and pull the \"free money\" switch."
